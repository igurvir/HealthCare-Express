# HealthCare Express  
**HealthCare Express** is a modern, secure, and scalable web application built with **TypeScript**, **JavaScript**, and **Firebase**. It serves as a dedicated **marketplace for traditional and herbal medicines**, including Ayurvedic, Homeopathic, and Indigenous remedies. Despite the massive global demand for alternative healthcare solutions, the market remains fragmented ‚Äî lacking a unified, trusted digital platform.  

HealthCare Express addresses this gap by offering a seamless experience for both buyers and sellers. From user authentication and real-time inventory tracking to secure payments and role-based admin management, the platform is built with accessibility, reliability, and growth in mind. Developed with an agile approach, HealthCare Express is structured for long-term scalability and optimized for secure, efficient commerce in the traditional medicine space.
